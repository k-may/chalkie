Convex Hull



This is a simple program that generates a file of random points on a scatter plot, then takes two different approaches to solving the convex-hull point set for the scattered data. It uses the Brute-Force algorithm and the Quick Hull algorithm to find the outer most points of the scattered plots, and offers the ability to run a time-evaluation to effectively show the efficiency difference between the two algorithms. This program lacks a GUI and is completely controlled with keyboard input in the console.
